If you'd like to contribute, submit a pull request. New features would be great. There are only a few rules:

0. All code must be in shell script or modern C++.
1. Code should make use of existing functions for output and logging. For example, try to use the Output class to make things simpler.
2. Stay away from the bad old C functions like malloc(), strcpy(), or `new`.
3. **All PRs must pass all GitHub Actions CI builds before being approved!**
