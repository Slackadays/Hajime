                        </div>
			If you're looking to start a Minecraft server and don't know what a "server.jar" or "Java flags" are, then Hajime is your ticket. No more hassle from other startup scripts! <br><br>
			If you're a power user wanting to get the maximum performance and features from your servers without using Docker or Kubernetes, then Hajime is for you. Take advantage of multithreading and more! <br><br>
			If you're a programmer interested in free, open source software, then Hajime is just what the doctor ordered. We couldn't have done it without you!
			<br><br>
			No matter who you are, Hajime is here to help.

			     About Hajime
			</div>
			Hajime was created to fill a void in the world of Minecraft servers. Unlike other startup scripts which are more developer-oriented,
			Hajime focuses on a pure user experience. That is, we focus on making it easy for everyone. This means creating a powerful user interface while still retaining comprehensability.
			What's more is that most other startup scripts have dependencies; this means you need extra software to run them. Hajime is different. If you can compile it, then it'll run. <br><br>
			All of these factors combine together to create a program that's user-friendly yet jam-packed with functionality.

			Hajime is supported on macOS. Unfortunately, the main development happens on Linux. To fix this, MacStadium's FOSS program lets us use a free Mac Mini to develop Hajime with. Check MacStadium out <a href="https://www.macstadium.com/">here!</a>
